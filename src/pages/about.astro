								<h1>About The Self-Taught Scholar</h1>
								<p class="intro">
									This is an experiment in building educational infrastructure that actually works—accessible,
									cross-disciplinary, and designed around how people really learn.

						<!-- The Problem -->
						<section>
							<Stack space="var(--space-m)">
								<h2>The Problem</h2>
								<div class="prose flow">
									<p>
										Traditional education has a strange relationship with actual learning. We spend years
										in classrooms, accumulate credentials, and often walk away feeling like we missed
										something essential. The promise is that structured curriculum and expert instruction
										will produce capable, knowledgeable people. Sometimes it does. Often it doesn't.
									</p>
									<p>
										The real issue isn't that universities are useless—they're not. It's that they've
										become the <em>only</em> legitimate path to education, and they're expensive, slow,
										and increasingly disconnected from what people actually need to know.
									</p>
									<p>
										Meanwhile, real learning keeps happening elsewhere. A single book can restructure
										how you see the world. A weekend project can teach more than a semester of theory.
										Conversations with practitioners reveal what textbooks hide. The most valuable
										education often happens outside the classroom—yet we keep pretending otherwise.
									</p>
									<p>
										Liberal arts education—the kind that teaches you to think across disciplines, to see
										patterns that connect ideas, to write and reason clearly—is genuinely valuable.
										But it's been gatekept by institutions that charge six figures and take four years
										to deliver it. That seems like a problem worth solving.
									</p>

						<!-- The Solution -->
						<section>
							<Stack space="var(--space-m)">
								<h2>The Solution</h2>
								<div class="prose flow">
									<p>
										The Self-Taught Scholar is my attempt to build what I wish had existed: a cross-disciplinary
										curriculum organized around transferable principles rather than credentials.
									</p>
									<p>
										The structure is simple. Four schools of knowledge—Pattern & Play, Story & Expression,
										Society & Self, and Making—represent the domains that matter most for understanding
										the world and doing meaningful work. These aren't arbitrary categories; they're the
										pillars that support almost everything worth learning.
									</p>
									<p>
										Content is organized into <strong>Atoms</strong> and <strong>Scrolls</strong>. Atoms are
										bite-sized concepts—foundational ideas you can learn in minutes but build on for years.
										Scrolls are curated learning paths that combine atoms into coherent journeys. Think of
										atoms as Lego bricks and scrolls as the instruction manuals that show you what to build.
									</p>
									<p>
										The philosophy behind this comes from Scott Adams: being excellent at one thing is hard
										and risky, but being good at several complementary things is achievable and often more
										valuable. A programmer who writes well has an edge. A writer who understands psychology
										creates more compelling work. The combinations matter more than the individual skills.
									</p>
									<p>
										This isn't about replacing universities. It's about providing an alternative path for
										people who want to learn without going into debt, who want cross-disciplinary thinking
										without arbitrary prerequisites, who want to build capability rather than collect credentials.
									</p>

						<!-- Why I'm Building This -->
						<section>
							<Stack space="var(--space-m)">
								<h2>Why I'm Building This</h2>
								<div class="prose flow">
									<p>
										I went through the traditional path—business and math as an undergrad, data science
										in grad school. The credentials look fine on paper. But looking back, the most
										important things I learned came from outside the curriculum.
									</p>
									<p>
										A single book like "Zero to One" reshaped how I think about building things. It took
										maybe eight hours to read. Entire courses didn't have that impact. That gap between
										time invested and insight gained has always bothered me. Why does so much formal
										education produce so little actual understanding?
									</p>
									<p>
										Jordan Peterson once said something that stuck with me: focus on the things that
										bother you and try to make them better. Education bothers me. Not because learning
										is hard—it should be—but because we've built systems that make it harder than
										necessary, more expensive than it needs to be, and less effective than it could be.
									</p>
									<p>
										So this is my attempt to fix what I can. I'm not naive about it—one person can't
										redesign education. But I can build something useful, test what works, and iterate.
										Maybe it helps a few people learn more effectively. Maybe it becomes something bigger.
										Either way, it's better than just complaining about the problem.

						<!-- The Approach -->
						<section>
							<Stack space="var(--space-m)">
								<h2>The Approach</h2>
								<div class="prose flow">
									<p>
										I'm building this in public, which means you're seeing it in progress. The Library
										of Atoms is growing—foundational concepts across the four schools, organized for
										easy reference and spaced repetition. The first Scroll is in development, a structured
										learning path that will combine atoms into a coherent curriculum.
									</p>
									<p>
										The blog is where I work through ideas about learning, education, and cross-disciplinary
										thinking. Essays will go deeper on foundational topics—the kind of evergreen pieces
										you can return to. Everything is connected; reading one thing should make you curious
										about another.
									</p>
									<p>
										This approach is deliberately iterative. I'd rather ship something useful and improve
										it based on feedback than spend years building in isolation. If an atom is confusing,
										I'll rewrite it. If a scroll doesn't work, I'll restructure it. The goal is to
										create something that actually helps people learn, not to prove that my initial
										design was correct.
									</p>

						<!-- What's Next -->
						<section>
							<Stack space="var(--space-m)">
								<h2>What's Next</h2>
								<div class="prose flow">
									<p>
										Right now, I'm focused on building the foundation. Growing the Library with essential
										atoms across all four schools. Developing the first Scroll—a structured learning path
										that demonstrates what this approach can offer. Writing regularly about the ideas
										that underpin all of this.
									</p>
									<p>
										If this resonates with you, there are a few ways to get involved. Subscribe to follow
										along as the platform develops. Read the blog to see if this perspective on learning
										matches yours. And if you have thoughts, feedback, or questions, reach out. Building
										in public means building with the community that forms around the work.
									</p>
									<p>
										This is version 0.1. It will get better. Thanks for being here early.
