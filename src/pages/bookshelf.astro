		description: "The book that revealed the monomyth — the deep structure beneath every hero's journey, from Odysseus to Luke Skywalker. Campbell didn't invent this pattern; he uncovered it across every culture and era. Once you see it, you recognize it everywhere: in stories, in life transitions, in the way we make meaning out of struggle.",

		title: 'The Anatomy of Story',
		author: 'John Truby',
		url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479933?tag=selftaughtsch-20',
		description: 'Where Campbell maps the universal myth, Truby maps the mechanics. Twenty-two steps, not as formula, but as organic structure — the way a story grows from a single moral problem into a complete world. The most rigorous book on story architecture available.',

		title: 'Story',
		author: 'Robert McKee',
		url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060391685?tag=selftaughtsch-20',
		description: "McKee's masterwork on the principles behind great storytelling. Not a template — a way of thinking about how meaning is created through structure, character, and scene. Dense, demanding, and the book working screenwriters actually reference.",

		title: 'Save the Cat',
		author: 'Blake Snyder',
		url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/1932907009?tag=selftaughtsch-20',
		description: "The most practical book on story structure ever written. Snyder breaks screenwriting into a repeatable framework — not to make stories formulaic, but to reveal the architecture that makes audiences *feel* something. Useful far beyond Hollywood.",

	{
		title: 'The Visual Story',
		author: 'Bruce Block',
		url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/113801415X?tag=selftaughtsch-20',
		description: 'Every frame tells a story through visual structure — contrast, affinity, space, line, shape, color, movement, rhythm. Block teaches you to see the invisible grammar of images. Essential for anyone who works with visual media, and quietly useful for anyone who thinks in spatial terms.',

		author: 'Nancy Duarte',
		url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470632011?tag=selftaughtsch-20',
		description: "Duarte maps story structure onto presentations and proves that the best communicators aren't informing — they're transforming. The audience starts in one place and ends in another, and the speaker's job is to build the bridge. A framework book disguised as a presentation book.",

		title: 'The Elements of Eloquence',
		author: 'Mark Forsyth',
		url: 'https://www.amazon.com/dp/042527618X?tag=selftaughtsch-20',
		description: "Most people think great writing is about having something to say. Forsyth makes the case that it's about *how* you say it — and that rhetoric has a toolbox as precise as mathematics. This is the book that makes you realize Shakespeare wasn't a genius who transcended technique. He was a genius *because* of technique.",

		title: 'On Writing Well',
		author: 'William Zinsser',

		description: "The companion to *Writing to Learn* and one of the best books on nonfiction craft in print. Zinsser strips writing down to its essentials: clarity, simplicity, brevity, and humanity. If *Writing to Learn* is about why you should write, this is about how to do it well.",

		description: 'Not a diet book. A 600-page investigation into how nutritional science went wrong — how institutions, incentives, and bad statistics created a consensus that may have caused more harm than good. A case study in what happens when a field gets stuck at "lines" and refuses to think in systems.',

								Many of these books belong in more than one School — and that's the point.
								<em>Moneyball</em> is about pattern recognition (Pattern & Play) but also about
								the courage to ignore consensus (Society & Self). <em>Resonate</em>
								is about story structure (Story & Expression) but also about craft (Making).
								<em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> touches all four Schools simultaneously.
